Fetal electrocardiogram (fECG) extraction from a mixed abdominal signal holds immense potential for non-invasive fetal heart monitoring during pregnancy. 
However, this process is complicated by the dominance of the maternal ECG (mECG) and various other noises. 
This project explores advanced signal processing techniques to achieve efficient fECG extraction. 
The project uses investigating methods like stationary wavelet transform, recursive least square (RLS) filter algorithm, threshold-based denoising, and independent component analysis. A crucial aspect of the project will be the development of robust noise reduction techniques to further refine the extracted fECG signal. 
The successful implementation of this project will lead to a more reliable and non-invasive approach to fetal heart rate monitoring, potentially improving pregnancy care and its outcomes.
